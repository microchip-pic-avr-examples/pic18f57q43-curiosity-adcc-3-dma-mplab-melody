 * @brief This is the generated driver implementation file for the MAIN driver.
 *
 * @version MAIN Driver Version 1.0.0
 * 
 * @details This project demonstrates context switching for the ADCC
  * (ADC with Computation) peripheral. The switch is automated
  * using the DMA subsystem. The general flow is
  * 1. set up the system
  * 2. use DMA to configure the ADC and initialize the math context
  * 3. wait for the ADC conversion done, triggered by TMR0
  * 4. use DMA to save the updated ADC context and configuration
  * 5. install a new configuration
  * 6. print the resulting values from the saved context
  * 7. repeat indefinitely from step 3
  * 
  * The project configuration is managed by Melody, and requires
  * both TMR0 (periodic free running) and ADC (right-justified 
  * results, triggered by TMR0). All other parameters may be 
  * configured as desired.
